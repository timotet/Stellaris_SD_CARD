# Stellaris_SD_CARD
Access a SD card with the TI stellaris LP.

Simple TI Stellaris launchpad project using the sd card booster pack from the 43oh webiste.
The project uses hardware spi to communicate with both the ILI9225B lcd boosterpack and the sd card boosterpack.
It's rough but was just a proof of concept.
