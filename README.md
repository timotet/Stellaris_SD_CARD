# Stellaris_SD_CARD
Access a SD card with the TI stellaris LP
Simple TI Stellaris launchpad project using the sd card booster pack from the 43oh webiste.
The prooject uses hardware spi to communicate with both the lcd boosterpack and the sd card boosterpack.
It's rough but was just a proof of concept.
